# Nonverse Members App v1.0
This repository contains the original Nonverse members app which was created whilst the network architecture was still being designed. It contained acted as a portal for a number of different apps and services that were planned but have since been dropped.

Since then Nonverse's main focus will be on creating a quality Minecraft server network and will NOT be offering any other services as of the time of writing [08-09-2021]

- Version 1.0 of the Nonverse members app is now fully deprecated and all development for it has been ceased as with all repositories under the redundancy organization.
- The app has since been replaced by the **MC-Java** app which was being developed alongside the original members app
- The existing Minecraft **MC-Java** app will be renamed to **Members**
- The newer version of the app **[MC-Java]** which can be found [here](https://github.com/nonverse/members) will now be hosted on the original members app host, **my.nonverse.net**

Please note that the current active version of the Nonverse Members APP [v2.x] is also being developed while the network is still being planned and designed. Any repositories under the active organization are NOT final
